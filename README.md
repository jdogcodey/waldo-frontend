# Waldo Front End

This is following the Where's Waldo Project as on The Odin Project. 

So, I think that I have set up the backend correctly. Thus far I have GET scores, POST start game and POST finish game. 

On the front end, I need the user to input their username, then show them an image and when they click on it register where they click and send this to the backend. 

Also I will have a leaderboard page separately. 

To Do List: 
 - Highlight their score on the scoreboard
